### Open the client side app at the location indicted in the terminal

### Navigate to the "Admin" page using the banner button.

### Click buttons to populate database with Api information for RestAPI and Outline map.

* If you want random tracking data for testing purposes, click the random buttons. Otherwise chose blank to track your performance

* RestAPI should have 250 entries, and Outline map should have 257. If you have more wipe the database using 'npm run seeds' on the backend.
